# AmmoExpansionCompatHH
compatibility mod to allow Hooch's Heat weapons to use Ammunition Expansion ammo 

this is just going to be a bunch of magazine and chamberable overrides so the guns from Hooch's Heat that use ammunitions that have equivalents in Ammunition Expansion can use both

modeled after the EFT compatibility mods
